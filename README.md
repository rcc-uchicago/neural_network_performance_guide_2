# neural_network_performance_guide_2
Materials for RCC workshop "Performance Guidelines of Neural Network Models, Part 2
### Abstract
Hyper-parameter selection impacts the performance of various types of neural network layers commonly used in state-of-the-art deep learning applications.

### Objectives:
During the workshop participants will be able to:
Understand performance
How to measure (operation speed) performance
Distinguish the difference between math-limited and bandwidth-limited operations
How to choose parameters to optimize execution efficiency
Apply general recommendations to particular routines

### Level: 
  Intermediate
  
  
### Duration: 
  2.5 hours
  
  
### Prerequisites: 
All participants are expected to bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on.  This workshop assumes participants possess prior programming experience, particularly in Python and Jupyter Notebook. An RCC account is not required
